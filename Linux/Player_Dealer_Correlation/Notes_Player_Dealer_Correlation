After analyzing the wins/losses from each date (March 10, 12, and 15),
I found that there was a player who was playing each time the casino
suffered a loss: Mylie Schmidt. She showed up in all 13 games that were a
loss. I referenced these dates and times to find who the primary dealer
was for these games, and my results found that Billy Jones was the dealer
for EVERY game she played. I believe this dealer and player are colluding
to scam the Lucky Duck Casino based on my findings.
